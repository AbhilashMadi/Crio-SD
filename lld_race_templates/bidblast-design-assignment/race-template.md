## **Winning Mechanism**

1. **How the Winner is Decided**:

   - The **lowest unique bid** is declared the winner.

2. **What Happens If Thereâ€™s No Lowest Unique Bid?**
   - The winner is decided based on the **earliest submission**:
     - If the lowest bid (e.g., **78**) is not unique (e.g., 3 members submitted it), the member who submitted their bid set **first** among those with the lowest bid wins.

---

## **Example Scenario**

- **Lowest Bid**: 78
- **Submitted by**:
  - Member A (submitted at 2:30 PM)
  - Member B (submitted at 2:45 PM)
  - Member C (submitted at 2:35 PM)
- **Winner**: Member A, because their bid set was submitted earliest among the members with the lowest bid.

---
